Hello! This is another basic class I created for my Object Oriented Programming course. It allows
a user to create objects of type distance, where objects have attributes miles, yards, feet, inches,
and totalInches. Distances can be created with a default constructor, where the distance initializes to 
zero, a single parameter constructor, where the number of inches is converted to a full distance, and a 
four-parameter constructor, where users can pass in miles, yards, feet, and inches. 

The focus of this class was operator overloading, so naturally you will find many operator overload functions. The stream 
IO operators(<< and >>) the multiply, add, and subtract operators(*, +, -), the comparison operators(<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=),
and the increment and decrement operators(++ and --) were all overloaded so they can be completed with distance object(s).
